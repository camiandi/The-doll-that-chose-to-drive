# The doll that chose to drive

Blender-based Final Team Project of the Polytechnic of Turin Computer Animation course. The project consisted in the replicate 30s of an original video exploiting the animation techniques learned in class.
My main role was to animate all the characters representing cars as well as managing the lighting of the scenes. Finally, I aid with the animation of the doll in the first two scenes.
