# The doll that chose to drive

Blender-based Final Team Project of the Polytechnic of Turin Computer Animation course. The project consisted in the replicate 30s of an original video [CGI Animated Spot HD "The Doll that Chose to Drive" by Post23 | CGMeetup
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_7G4hPQpe8&t=46s) exploiting the animation techniques learned in class.

My main role was to animate all the characters representing cars as well as managing the lighting of the scenes. Finally, I aid with the animation of the doll in the first two scenes.
